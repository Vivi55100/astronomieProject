        NASA’s Psyche spacecraft will travel to a metal-rich asteroid by the same name orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter to study it’s composition.
        The spacecraft also carries the agency's Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration, which will test laser communications beyond the Moon.

    <img src="../assets/img/hubble-LEDA_42160.jpg" alt="This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows LEDA 42160, a galaxy about 52 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo.
        The dwarf galaxy is one of many forcing its way through the comparatively dense gas in the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies.
        The pressure exerted by this intergalactic gas, known as ram pressure, has dramatic effects on star formation in LEDA 42160.

        NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope delivered highly detailed scenes of this and other nearby spiral galaxies in a combination of near-and mid-infrared light.

    <img src="../assets/img/Cassiopeia.png" alt="NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s new view of Cassiopeia A (Cas A) in near-infrared light is giving astronomers hints at the dynamical processes occurring within the supernova remnant. 
        Tiny clumps represented in bright pink and orange make up the supernova’s inner shell, and are comprised of sulfur, oxygen, argon, and neon from the star itself.
        A large, striated blob at the bottom right corner of the image, nicknamed Baby Cas A, is one of the few light echoes visible NIRCam’s field of view.
        In this image, red, green, and blue were assigned to Webb’s NIRCam data at 4.4, 3.56, and 1.62 microns (F444W, F356W, and F162M, respectively).

    <img src="../assets/img/earth.jpg" alt="On October 14, 2023, the Moon aligned with the Sun and Earth to produce an annular solar eclipse.
        The spectacle bathed millions of Americans in a lunar shadow as the Moon blocked the Sun’s rays.
        The above image was acquired during the eclipse by NASA’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera imager aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory,
        a joint NASA, NOAA, and U.S. Air Force satellite.

        Flight VA261 carried two payloads into space
        the German space agency DLR’s experimental communications satellite Heinrich Hertz and the French communications satellite Syracuse 4b.
        The flight is the 117th and final mission for Ariane 5, a series which began in 1996.
